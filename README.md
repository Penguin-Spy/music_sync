# Music Sync
Syncs what specific background music is playing between all players!  
The music volume slider still controls the music volume.  
All players must have the resourcepack loaded to hear the synced music.  
This datapack/resourcepack is intended to be used with vanilla Minecraft 1.20. Compatability with other datapacks, mods, or resourcepacks is not garunteed; in particular you will almost definetly not hear any new music tracks added by other things, and no music will play in custom biomes/dimensions.
